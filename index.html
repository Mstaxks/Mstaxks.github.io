    <p>Hello my name is Emmanuel  R.</p>
    <p>I am 16yrs old and working as a Full stack developer, I'm currently still in highshool as a 11th grade student. I have recently started to get to understanding coding such as H.T.M.L, and C.S.S.</p>
    <p>I would consider myself as a modest artist who can do simple designs on paper, also being better at designing things on websites such as:</p>
    
    <div class="list-image-container">
        <ul>
            <li>Canva</li>   
            <li>Picsart</li>
            <li>App diagrams</li>
        </ul>
        <img width="200" src="Emmanuel.svg">
    </div>
    <p>
    I'm also a decent video editor for pictures simply giving the my personal spin on lighting, color contrast, and various touch ups that the picture really needs.
